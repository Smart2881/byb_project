## Image Processing :

* Import all the relevant libraries and tools.
* Load the MNIST dataset. Use a library such as scikit-learn to access the dataset (from sklearn.datasets import load_digits).
* Reshaped the image and plotted to show trainined images.
* Split the data into train and test sets.
* Added comments explaining the purpose of the train and test sets.
* Used the RandomForestClassifier built into scikit-learn to create a classification model.
* Made prediction on test data set.
* Picked one parameter to tune, and explain why you chose this parameter.
* Selected a value for the parameter to use during testing on the test data, and provided a rationale for the choice.
* Printed the confusion matrix for the Random Forest model on the test set and evaluate the classifier's performance.
* Tuned using GridSearchCV.
* Reported which classes the model struggles with the most.
* Reported the accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score.
* Used average=”macro” in precision_score, recall_score and f1_score from scikit-learn.
